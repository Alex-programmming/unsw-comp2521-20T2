<h1> Lab Exercises Week 1</h1>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> To practise programming linked lists
</li><li> To practise programming doubly linked lists
</li><li> To practise using tools such as gdb and valgrind
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<h2> Assessment </h2>
<p>
</p><p><b>Deadline</b>: 11:59pm Tue 8 December 2015
</p><p><b>Total Marks</b>: 3


</p><p>
You must get your tutor in your lab to mark the exercises during the allocated 
lab time or the following week if you submitted your lab on time using 
give. 
Try to get them to mark each exercise as you complete it in your lab time if 
possible.
In addition to the code that the exercise calls for, you will of course have to write some additional code to test the correctness of your implementation. 
Your tutor may want to see this testing code, too. Good style requires good tests! 
</p>



<h2>Exercise 1 - Linked Lists (0.5 mark)</h2>
<p>
Copy the files <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1927/15x1/labs/lab01/lists.h"> lists.h 
</a>, <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1927/15x1/labs/lab01/lists.c"> 
lists.c </a> and 
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1927/15x1/labs/lab01/testLists.c"> 
testLists.c </a>into your working directory. The file <code> lists.c 
</code> 
contains a <code>printList</code> function and stubs for other functions 
you need to implement to complete the lab. You can use <code> testLists.c 
</code> to write your tests, but do not edit <code>lists.h</code>
</p>
<p>
Implement the function </p><pre>int sumListItems (link ls);
</pre>
which adds all the items in a list and returns the resulting integer value, 
and and tests to <code>testLists.c</code>. Test it for lists with zero, 
one, and some more elements.
<p></p>
<p>
Compile your program with the command
</p><pre>	 gcc -Wall -Werror -gdwarf-2 -o  testLists testLists.c lists.c
</pre>
<p></p>
The <tt>-gdwarf-2</tt> option makes sure that debug information is generated. 
<p>
Execute your program in <tt>gdb</tt> or <tt>ddd</tt> and show your tutor that you can:
</p><ol>
		<li> set a breakpoint at the beginning of a function and at a given line in the program </li>
		<li> know how to inspect the elements of a list using the <tt>print</tt> command</li>
		<li> inspect the call stack. 
			</li>
			</ol>

<h2>Exercise 2 - Linked Lists (0.5 mark)</h2>
<p> Type in the command
</p><pre>valgrind ./testLists
</pre>
The output should show you that you have some memory leaks - assuming you
have written some code in testLists that actually adds some nodes to your
linked list.


<p>
Implement the function 
</p><pre>void freeList(link list); 
</pre>
that frees all the memory for each node in 
your list. Once you have written the function, test it in your testLists 
code. Run valgrind again and check that all the memory leaks have gone. 
You must be able to show this to your tutor.
<p></p>

			
<h2>Exercise 3 - Linked Lists (1 mark)</h2>	
<p>
Implement the function
</p><pre>link fromTo (int start, int end);
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
which creates a list with the elements <tt>start</tt>
to <tt>end</tt>. If <tt>start</tt> is  greater    than <tt>end</tt>, return the empty
list. 

Examples:
</p><pre>fromTo (2,6)      2 -&gt;3 -&gt;4 -&gt;5 -&gt;6 -&gt;X
fromTo (3,3)      3 -&gt;X
fromTo (4,3)      -&gt;X
</pre>
<p></p>

<h2>Exercise 4 - Doubly Linked Lists (1 mark)</h2>	
<p>
Write a function 
</p><pre>dlink doublify (link ls)
</pre>
which, given a linked list, creates a new doubly linked list with the same items as elements.
You might want to write a printDList function to test it.
<p>You must also write a function

</p><pre>void freeDList(dlink list);
</pre>

and make sure you can demonstrate that you have freed the 
memory correctly to your tutor.


<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2>Submitting your lab</h2>
 You must get the lab marked by your tutor in your lab. You should also submit your solution using give on a CSE machine. To do this, run:

<pre>1927 classrun 16x1 give lab01 lists.c
</pre>
